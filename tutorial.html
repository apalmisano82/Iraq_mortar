                This application is very simple (but it does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a photograph of an archaeological artefact. Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to click or tap around the edge of the artefact in order to define a polygon outline. Click once every time you wish to add a point along the edge of the polygon and your final point will snap back onto the one you started with. You can draw one polygon around the entire object or instead draw a series of overlapping polygons if you prefer. In general, we would like you to draw your polygon(s) very slightly inside the actual edge of the artefact. This is because we don't want background pixels near this edge to create a fuzzy border, and we don't need to worry so much about losing a bit of the artefact edge, as the missing few pixels are very likely to appear in one of the other photographs (at least 40 overlapping photographs are likely to exist for each object to support the construction of the 3D model). An example of a successful outline is shown below:

                How to use the buttons relating to the photo-masking application:

                <p><strong>Outline</strong>: This option is selected by default and indicates the actions that relate to the drawing of a polygon around the object.</p>
                <p><strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default at the beginning of every task. Clink on 'Draw' every time you want to start drawing the outline of an object. Once you have completed the polygon, the outline around the object will become yellow.</p>
                <p><strong>Edit</strong>: This option becomes possible once the polygon has been drawn. Once you have clicked on 'Edit', choose the polygon that you wish to modify by clicking once on any part of the polygon. The line of the polygon will become blue, indicating that it will be possible to modify it. </p>
                <p><strong>Remove all polygons</strong>: Use  this option if you want to start from the beginning. By clicking on this option you will remove all the polygons you have drawn before.</p>
                <p> <strong>Save the drawings</strong>: Click on this option every time you have finished drawing an outline - it will save your work.</p>
